# Python-MySql
All the programming codes used in connecting python with MySql.
Python can be used in database applications.
One of the most popular databases is MySQL.
Python needs a MySQL driver to access the MySQL database.
In this tutorial we will use the driver "MySQL Connector".
We recommend that you use PIP to install "MySQL Connector".
PIP is most likely already installed in your Python environment.
Navigate your command line to the location of PIP, and type the following.


C:\Users\Your Name\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\Scripts>python -m pip install mysql-connector
